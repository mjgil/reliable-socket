                | Click the button on the left to simulate a socket closing.
                | You are given a random name and are connected to a socket that 
                | sends data to the server once every 200 milliseconds. After
                | pressing the button, the socket will disconnect and try to 
                | reconnect within 5 seconds. If it does reconnect not at the end of 5
                | seconds, then the socket will close for good. If, during that
                | time, the socket reconnects, it will poll for missed packets.
                | Your missed packets will be shown in inverted colors below.
                | Also, try opening a different browser to get the full chat 
                | room experience (other users packets will not be highlighted).
