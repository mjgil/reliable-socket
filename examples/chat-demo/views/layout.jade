                    span.bold Click the button 
                    | on the left to simulate a socket closing.
                    | You are given a random name and are connected to a socket that 
                    | sends data to the server once every 
                    span.bold 500 milliseconds. 
                    | After
                    | pressing the button, the socket will disconnect and try to 
                    | reconnect within 
                    span.bold 5 seconds. 
                    | If it does reconnect not at the end of 5
                    | seconds, then the socket will close for good. If, during that
                    | time, the socket reconnects, it will poll for missed packets.
                    | Your missed packets will be shown in inverted colors below.
                p
                    | Also, try opening a 
                    span.bold different browser 
                    | to get the full chat 
                    | room experience (other users packets will not be highlighted).
